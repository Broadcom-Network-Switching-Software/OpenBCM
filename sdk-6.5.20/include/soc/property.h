                               In the above image the physical lane swap crossed the core boundary on core1&2 and
                               there is no logical to logical mapping for  lanes 4 to 11 on the system side of ExtPhy
                               with the internal PHY. If the user wants to run the PRBS on logical lane 4
                               (on internal PHY core1 logical lane 0), the driver can query the DB
                               and get the necessary physical lane information (physical lane 8 in this case).
