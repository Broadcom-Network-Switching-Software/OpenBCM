Assuming a Solaris or Linux build server with one or more of the
following cross-compilers installed:

	* Diab Data DCC ColdFire
	* Tornado x86
	* Tornado MIPS
	* Tornado PPC

This explains how to set the target to build the Strata device drivers
for that a particular platform and chip.

Target Makefiles for the SAL and SOC device driver:

Remember that $TARGET is set to <TARGETBASE>-<TARGETPLAT>.  <TARGETBASE>
represents the operating system environment, and <TARGETPLAT> represents
the platform.  For example:

	BMW CPCI card
		setenv TARGET vxworks-bmw
		<TARGETBASE> is vxworks
		<TARGETPLAT> is bmw

	Unix PCID simulation
		setenv TARGET unix-solaris
		<TARGETBASE> is unix
		<TARGETPLAT> is solaris

	Linux PCID simulation
		setenv TARGET unix-linux
		<TARGETBASE> is unix
		<TARGETPLAT> is linux

For VxWorks builds of existing BSPs, edit the platform Makefile.$TARGET
and modify WIND_BASE so it points to your installed VxWorks tree.

Then to build a BSP and link to binary, go to the

	sdk/systems/<TARGETBASE>/<TARGETPLAT>

directory corresponding to the system and run gmake.

It is possible to run 'make' in any subdirectory of the driver source
tree by setting the environment variable TARGET appropriately.  The
compiled objects will go into that target's build subdirectory,
sdk/build/$TARGET.  For example:

	setenv TARGET vxworks-bmw
	cd $SDK/src/soc
	make drv.o

To compile a driver that only supports specific chips, see instructions
in $SDK/make/Make.local.template.  Copy Make.local.template to
Make.local and make the required modifications.  By default, the driver
will be built to include code for all supported chips.  You may be able
to save some code space by customizing in support for only one or two
chips.

Adding new VxWorks platforms:

1) Pick a <TARGETPLAT> name for your BSP, eg, my_board_name.

2) Create a new Makefile.vxworks-my_board_name in $SDK/make.
   It is easiest to copy from a similar existing Makefile and
   modify it.

3) Create a new directory tree structure in $SDK/systems:

   $SDK/systems/<TARGETBASE>/<TARGETPLAT>

   Where TARGETBASE is vxworks and <TARGETPLAT> is your platofmr name, e.g.

   $SDK/systems/vxworks/my_board_name

4) Copy the file socdiag.c and Makefile from an existing
   directory in that configuration into the new directory.

   $SDK/systems/vxworks/my_board_name/socdiag.c
   $SDK/systems/vxworks/my_board_name/Makefile

5) Place all your BSP files in the new <TARGETPLAT> directory.

6) Edit the Makefiles in the directory tree, overriding
   the target in the toplevel Makefile and pulling in
   $SDK/make/Makefile.<TARGETBASE>-<TARGETPLAT>
