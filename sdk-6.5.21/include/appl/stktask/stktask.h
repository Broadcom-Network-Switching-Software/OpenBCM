/****************************************************************
 *
 * Event precedence:
 *
 * NOTE:  The order of these flags determines the order in which
 * they are processed when multiple events are pending.
 *
 * 
 * Events trigger transitions from one state to another.  The order of
 * events in this list is important because it determines the order in
 * which they are evaluated.  This affects the precedence of the events.
 * For example, UNBLOCK is first so that if UNBLOCK and BLOCK events are
 * seen together, the BLOCK event will be processed second, leaving Stack
 * Task in the BLOCKED state.
 * 
 * On the other hand, SUCCESS is given precedence over FAILURE in
 * general by appearing first (Stack Task will transition due to the
 * success signal first and then the failure will be discarded.)
 *
 * 
 * Below, "internal" means the event is generated by Stack Task;
 * "external" means the event may be expected to be generated by the
 * application via bcm_st_event_send.  Some events may be both.
 * 
 *     UNBLOCK (external)
 *         Transition from BLOCKED to READY.  This is sent by the
 *         application to indicate it is ready to participate in
 *         discovery.
 * 
 *     BLOCK (external)
 *         Transition to the BLOCKED state from any other state.  This is
 *         sent by the application and generally indicates an error
 *         state.  It will terminate a running discovery and prevent
 *         discovery from re-running until an UNBLOCK or TIMEOUT is
 *         received.
 * 
 *     LINK_UP, LINK_DOWN (internal, external)
 *         Stack Task registers with linkscan to receive link events.
 *         When that callback is made for a stack port, this event
 *         occurs. 
 * 
 *     DISC_PKT (internal, external)
 *         A discovery packet was received by Stack Task indicating some
 *         other box may be trying to start discovery.
 * 
 *     DISC_SUCCESS, DISC_FAILURE (internal)
 *         These are sent upon the completion of discovery.
 * 
 *     DISC_RESTART (internal, external)
 *         Indicates discovery should be restarted.
 * 
 *     TOPO_SUCCESS, TOPO_FAILURE (external)
 *         Results of topology processing.
 * 
 *     ATTACH_SUCCESS, ATTACH_FAILURE (external)
 *         Results of device attach processing.
 * 
 *     TIMEOUT (internal)
 *         A timeout has occurred for a phase.  Generally go to BLOCKED.
 * 
 *     COMM_FAILURE (internal, external)
 *         A communications failure has occurred.  This usually results
 *         in a restart of discovery.

 *     members and interconnections, filling out db_ref.  Once completed,

 * 
 * int (*bcm_st_master_f)(cpudb_ref_t db_ref);
 * 
 *     Takes a completed CPUDB and determines the master entry.  It sets

 *     BCM_E_NONE.
 * 
 * int (*bcm_st_disc_abort_f)(int disc_rv, int timeout_us);
 * 
 *     The caller (Stack Task) uses this to interrupt a running
 *     discovery.  It may intend to abort it or just to restart it.  This
 *     difference is reflected in the disc_rv that is passed which is
 *     used by discovery when it exits.
 * 
 *     If timeout_us > 0, the call will block until discovery
 *     acknowledges that it has exited (returns BCM_E_NONE), or until the
 *     timeout is reached (returns BCM_E_FAIL).

 * 
 * 
 *     If present, Stack Task calls this each time a state transition
 *     takes place.  Events sent to Stack Task from this callback will be
 *     processed after the transition has occurred.
 * 
 *     The disc_db and cur_db are pointers to the discovery and current
 *     database pointers.  In general, they should be treated as
 *     "read-only".  Either or both may be NULL; note that the case of
 *     "no previous successful discovery" can be detected by testing
 *     (cur_db == NULL).
 * 
 *     If the transition function returns an error (< 0) then ST will
 *     transition to BLOCKED (without an additional callback).

 * 
 *     These are called at the transitions to the TOPO and ATTACH states,
 *     respectively.  For st_topo, the discovery data base is passed as
 *     the parameter.  For st_attach, the new current database is passed
 *     as the parameter.
 * 
 *     The values for these functions in the Broadcom distribution are
 *     bcm_stack_topo_update and bcm_stack_attach_update.
 * 
 *     The return values for these functions are only used to generate
 *     warning messages if they fail.  The application must send a BLOCK
 *     event if it wishes to change the state of Stack Task.
